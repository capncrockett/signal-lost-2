## Development Guidelines
1. Always create feature branches from `develop`, never from `main`
2. Follow the established branching pattern: `feature/alpha/*` or `feature/beta/*`
3. Ensure all tests pass before merging PRs
4. Keep the TypeScript configuration consistent between local development and CI
5. Document API changes in the README
