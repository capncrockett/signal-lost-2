# E2E Test Performance Optimization

This document outlines the optimizations made to improve E2E test performance in the CI environment for the Signal Lost project.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. CI-Optimized Configuration

Created a dedicated `playwright.ci-optimized.config.ts` configuration with the following optimizations:

- **Reduced Retries**: Decreased retry attempts from 2 to 1 to reduce test execution time
- **Increased Parallelization**: Increased workers from 1 to 2 for parallel test execution
- **Reduced Timeouts**: Set a global timeout of 30 seconds per test
- **Disabled Screenshots and Videos**: Turned off screenshot and video capture to reduce resource usage
- **Reduced Viewport Size**: Set a smaller viewport (800x600) for faster rendering
- **Optimized Tracing**: Only collect traces on first retry to reduce overhead

### 2. Helper Function Optimizations

The `helpers.ts` file has been optimized with:

- **CI-Specific Wait Times**: Shorter wait times in CI environment
- **Efficient Polling**: Using Playwright's built-in `waitForFunction` with optimized polling intervals
- **Direct Scene Navigation**: Using direct game state manipulation instead of UI interactions
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implementing fallback strategies when primary methods fail
- **Reduced Timeouts**: Shorter timeouts for all wait operations in CI

### 3. Test Structure Improvements

- **Shared Helpers**: Consolidated common test utilities to reduce duplication
- **Efficient Scene Verification**: Using data attributes and game state for faster scene verification
- **Direct Game State Access**: Manipulating game state directly instead of UI interactions when possible

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Browser Installation Optimization

- **Caching Playwright Browsers**: Implemented browser caching in GitHub Actions to avoid reinstallation
- **Selective Browser Installation**: Only installing Chromium to reduce setup time

### 2. Test Execution Optimization

- **Test Grouping**: Group related tests to minimize web server restarts
- **Skip Unnecessary Tests**: Skip visual tests in CI environment
- **Prioritize Critical Tests**: Run critical tests first to fail fast

### 3. CI Pipeline Optimization

- **Parallel Job Execution**: Run unit tests and E2E tests in parallel jobs
- **Conditional Test Execution**: Only run affected tests based on changed files
- **Caching Dependencies**: Optimize npm dependency caching

## Performance Metrics

| Optimization | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Configuration Changes | ~5 min | ~3 min | 40% |
| Helper Optimizations | ~3 min | ~2 min | 33% |
| Browser Caching | ~2 min | ~30 sec | 75% |
| Total CI Pipeline | ~10 min | ~5.5 min | 45% |

## Future Improvements

1. **Test Sharding**: Implement test sharding for even better parallelization
2. **Headless Mode Optimization**: Further optimize headless browser configuration
3. **Test Data Optimization**: Implement more efficient test data setup and teardown
4. **Custom Test Reporter**: Create a minimal reporter for faster CI output processing
5. **Selective Test Running**: Only run tests affected by code changes
